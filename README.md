# Test-GitHub-Codespaces

This repository is created to test GitHub Codespaces and record its usage.

GitHub Codespaces is beta version currently, so our first step is to [Sign up for the Codespaces beta](https://github.com/features/codespaces/signup) and wait for reply. 

I signup up for the Codespaces beta at 2020-09-15 16:48 and got the "welcome" e-mail at 2020-09-18 22:15, which cost 
me about 3 days.
